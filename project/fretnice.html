			<h2>Fret Nice</h2>

			<div class="release">Release date: February 24, 2010</div>
			<p>My time at Pieces Interactive, working at Fret Nice, was a very valuable experiance. Although short, I learned a great deal. It was my first job in the game development industry, and my first and only job as quality assurance. We also worked very closely with the developers of the game and were provided with internal test specifications from them, as well as TCR/TRC's from SONY and Microsft respectively.</p>
			<p>The internal test spec was often about making sure levels could be completed, and things were balanced. The TCR/TRC was more technical, like making sure you could always go back to the playstation/xbox menu and thing like that.</p>
