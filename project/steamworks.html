			<h2>Ludosity's Steamworks Wrapper</h2>
			<div class="platform">Platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux</div>
			<div class="release">Release date: November 1, 2011 (Original version). September 4, 2014 (Current version)</div>
			<p>Continuing the development of this project was my first task when joining the company as an intern. After catching up on the current code, it quickly became up to date.</p>
			<p>With the lowered price from $300 to $50, continious updates and customer support the plugin gained popularity fast and was used by a great deal of developers wanting to get their game on steam.</p>
			<p>The project was discontinued late in 2014 when I left the company. The code went open-source, but never gained much attention due to the dropped support and rising popularity of competitor steamworks.net</p>
