			<h2>Ittle Dew</h2>
			<div class="platform">Platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux, Wii U, iOS, Android</div>
			<div class="release">Release date: July 23, 2013</div>
			<p>The first time I was employed at Ludosity was to work on Ittle Dew close to it's release. I mainly worked on fixing minor bugs.</p>
			<p>After release I also did my first porting job for Ludosity, I was supposed to get Ittle Dew onto the Ouya, which was somewhat of a challenge.</p>
			<p>None of the shaders would initially load, resulting in just a pink screen for some builds. Once the game was playable it ran at about five frames per second. So there was alot of optimization to do.</p>
			<p>Even though some effects had to be scaled down somewhat, the game was able to launch successfully</p>
