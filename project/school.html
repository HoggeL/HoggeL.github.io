			<p>During my years attending University of Sk√∂vde, I made several projects for coursework. The projects showcased here are from courses in Game Physics and Artificial Intelligence, as they are easy to provide pictures for.</p>
			<p>I will work towards setting up a github page with many of my projects which can't easily be provided through pictures. During a course in Operating Systems I added syscalls and reprogrammed the process scheduler in the minimalistic linux-based OS Minix.</p>
